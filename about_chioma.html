        <!--This is background information about where I'm from, my hobbies, and my family.-->
        <p>Hi! My name is <b>Chioma Njoku</b>, I'm 17 years old, and I'm originally from Philadelpia, Pennsylvania but currently live in Newark, <b>Delaware</b>. My hobbies consist of <b>watching movies, spending time with friends, and throwing shot put</b>. I am the oldest of three kids. My younger brother, Nnanna, is 16 years old while my little sister, Nkechi, is 10. We don't always see eye to eye but they're two of the best people I know.</p>
        <!--This is infromation about what I do outside of school as well as my favorite shows to watch.-->
        <p>When I'm not at school, I'm typically in my room watching a show or movie on Netflix. I recently started rewatching <i>Grey' Anatomy </i> and I've fallen in love with the show all over again. One of my favorite quotes from <i> Grey's Anatomy</i> is:</p> <blockquote>It can be scary to find out you've been wrong about something. But we can't be afraid to change our minds, to accept that things are different, that they'll never be the same, for better or for worse. We have to be willing to give up what we used to believe. The more we're willing to accept what is and not what we thought, we'll find ourselves exactly where we belong.</blockquote> <p>On Monday night's, I enjoy watching <i>The Bachelor</i> with my mom and sister. It's always fun gossiping about which girl we think will be eliminated or staying. Sometimes, we enjoy the show with ice cream! I take the following steps in order to make my ice cream treat:</p>

            <li>Put your desired amount of ice cream and toppings in the bowl.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>It's crazy to think that I've been at Padua for almost four years! Although at times I may complain about what feels like the slowest school days, the year is rapidly coming to an end. It feels like just yesterday I was a freshman but I'm excited to make the most out of my last few months here. While my journey at Padua has sped by, I'm excited to see what the next four years hold in store for me in college!</p>
